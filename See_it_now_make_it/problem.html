    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>Everything technological that is too time consuming is a problem from a technological
    perspective. Especially if we could get the work done in minutes. Let’s look at these kinds of
    problems. But first, let us ask you some questions. Are you aware of all the services that are
    connected to your email address? Have you always had the same email address ever since you
    created one? You would probably answer “no” to at least one of the questions above. Then you
    would probably have experienced problems with unwanted emails or problems with changing
    to new email address without knowing the important services that has your old email address.
    Let's look at what people say about this.</p>
    <h2>Our research</h2>
    <p>We made a survey consisting of six questions. The survey was conducted in november 2016
      among 100 email users from different age groups all around the world. The users were
      informed about that this survey is only being used to this final project. We will use the results of
      the survey to show the importance of the problems we will address soon. The results:</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./1.png" alt="In this picture you can see the selection of people questioned in the survey. We can see that the majority of the people who answered was between 19-40 years old."/>
      <p>Here we can see that 6% of the users were from age 12-18, 38% of user were from age 19-40,
      39% of the users were from age 41-55 and 6% from age 56+.</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./2.png" alt="This diagram provides information about how many e-mails the asked people have. We can see that majority has 2-5 e-mails."/>
      <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people didn't have the same email address ever since
      they created one.</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./3.png" alt="This diagram asked the people if they are aware of all the services connected to their e-mail address."/>
      <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people aren't aware of all the services connected to
      their email address.</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./4.png" alt="In this diagram the selected people was asked if it's a problem that they could not remember where their e-mail was registered."/>
      <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the people think that their unawareness of the places
      their email is registered to is a big problem.</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./6.png" alt="Diagram that shows how the people in the survey handle unwanted emails/spam. The majoirty choose to delete it, followed by ignoring it."/>
      <p>This diagram shows how our users handle unwanted emails. The majority of the users delete it,
      ignore it or try to unsubscribe from the sender.</p>
      <img id="bilde1" src="./5.png" alt="This diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application developted by us."/>
      <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application we will be
      describing as our solution for the problems we will be adressing now.</p>
        <h3>The First Problem</h3>
        <p>The first problem: Unwanted emails. How do you handle unwanted emails? You can try to
        manually go and unsubscribe from every sender of the unwanted emails, delete every time you
        get an unwanted email, ignore every time you get an unwanted email, set up filters or report
        the unwanted email as spam. Let’s look at how our email users handle this problem.</p>
          <img id="bilde1" src="./6.png" alt="Diagram that shows how the people in the survey handle unwanted emails/spam. The majoirty choose to delete it, followed by ignoring it."/>
          <h3>The Second Problem</h3>
          <p>The first time you created an email address, you probably wouldn’t have thought of using it for
              professional inquiries. So, your first email address would have been something like
              sexyboy97@live.no, barbie23@gmail.com, kittygirl@yahoo.com or kingofoslo@hotmail.com.
              And now you want your email address to be more professional. So, you create a new email
              address. Or you just have another good reason to change your email address, so you create a
              new one. Here you can see how many of our email users that have changed their email
              addresses. Which is over 90% as said earlier</p>
              <img id="bilde1" src="./2.png" alt="This diagram provides information about how many e-mails the asked people have. We can see that majority has 2-5 e-mails."/>
              <p>But you have your previous email address registered to so many services that you don’t have
                  any overview over the important ones. So, you must manually go and find the important
                  services and send an email about your new email address. This is also time consuming which is
                  also a problem from a technological perspective. And as said over 70% of our survey answerers
                  think this is a big problem too.</p>
                  <img id="bilde1" src="./4.png" alt="In this diagram the selected people was asked if it's a problem that they could not remember where their e-mail was registered."/>
                  <p>How can we possibly prevent this time-consuming work forever? The answer for this one is “eTracker”
                      too. What is this e-Tracker? The “e-Tracker” is a web-based application and our
                      solution for the problems we adressed. You can read about our solution by clicking "Solution" in
                      the navigation bar or you can click <a id="linksol" href="solution.html">here</a>.</p>
