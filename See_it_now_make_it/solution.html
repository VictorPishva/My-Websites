    <h1>The Solution</h1>
    <p>Our solution is a web-based application that collects all the services that has your e-mail
address into one place. With this solution you will get:
1. An overview of all the services connected with to your email address
2. The choice of removing your email address from the different services you are registered to
in a quicker and easier way
3. An easier and quicker way of letting services know about your new or changed email address
This solution results the best way to get rid of unwanted emails and makes sure you receive the
information you want to the correct e-mail address. Now, let’s get into the e-Tracker website.</p>
    <h2>e-Tracker: The first page</h2>
    <img id="bilde2" src="./h.png" alt="BESKRIVELSE"/>
    <p>What you see here is the e-Tracker’s home page. This is the first page you will see when you
    click into e-Tracker. Here we have a big get started button which will help you make a new user.
    Then we have our navigation bar which starts with home button for our first page. Then info
    button for more information about the e-Tracker than the first page. The next is a contact
    button which gives you contact information. The button “about us” gives you information
    about the founders of e-Tracker. Then we have the login button that log in those who already
    are an user of e-Tracker. We also have a tutorial video on this page that shows how to use eTracker
    application.</p>
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>Privacy is our number one priority when it comes to our users, we want them to feel as safe
      and secure as possible. Privacy is very important when it comes to e-mail, for that reason we
      have focused on a secure login, so only you can see the services you are registered to. We will
      use a verification method where you have to confirm your e-mail by clicking on a link that is
      sent to that particular e-mail that you wish to register. This way we know that the e-mail
      belongs to you and that you e-mail is not being misused. You as a user can also use a SMSservice
      verification so your user at our site is more secure. That is why our website is both
      secure and safe to use by design.</p>
        <h3>My Account</h3>
        <img id="bilde2" src="./sa.png" alt="BESKRIVELSE"/>
        <p>Here we see the site we will come to when we login. Now we have a “My Account” button
        instead of a login button. If we click that button, the site will open a drop down menu with
        “manage your email” which is the site you are on now, then “setting” for password change and
        other information change. Then we have “history” that gives you log of what you have done
        with your mails and services since you first created an e-Tracker user. And at the end we have a
        “Log out” button that log you out.
        </p>
          <h3>Manage your emails</h3>
          <p>You are able to use whichever e-mail client you want, for instance e-mail address from Gmail,
          Yahoo or Outlook. If you are using multiple e-mails you can add as many e-mail addresses as
          you wish by clicking “Add Email” . We highly suggest that you add your main accounts in order
          to maintain control over which services have access to your e-mail.</p>
            <h3>The Selected email address</h3>
            <img id="bilde2" src="./yt.png" alt="BESKRIVELSE"/>
            <p>When you select an account you get greeted with a detailed page about that particular account.
            Let’s say that your Facebook account is one of the listed items on the page. Selecting Facebook
            will provide short and concise information about the website. From here you also get the
            options to change or remove the linked e-mail address. This is especially handy if you want to
            use a different mail for the same Facebook account. Or - you could just remove the site so that
            it is no longer connected to your e-mail address.</p>
              <h3>The design: Accessible for everyone</h3>
              <p>Our design choices affects how our service is being used and who it is being used by. Because
              our goal is to include every single user that has minimum one email address, who can be
              anyone with or without disability, we had to consider every single aspect of our solution. So we
              used <a id="linksol" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/designing">tips on designing for web accessibility</a> from <a id="linksol" href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to make sure that the design is more
              accessible to people with disabilities. We also checked our web page at <a id="linksol" href="http://checkers.eiii.eu/">European Internet
              Inclusion Initiativ</a>, which checks the accessibility of a web page.</p>
                <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                <p>The technology that you are using should be adapting to the context that you are using it in. We
                don’t have our computers available to us at all times and therefore it would be a great
                disadvantage if the technology did not adjust to our demands. From a smartphone you can use
                our service just the way you are used to from the desktop experience. As well as tablets. That
                will make us have a greater audience.</br></br>
                But, how did we make our website responsive? We just made sure that we didn’t use any
                absolute sizes in our website. Every single element in the website has its size defined by relative
                units, which makes our website responsive to different mediums. Sometimes relative units
                won’t work as good as we thought, then we just make the design a little bit different for </p>
