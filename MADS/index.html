          <p>MADS will give an aural notification when the pills are to be taken. The machine will then dispense the correct dose of medication for the patient. If the patient needs any help regarding how to consume the medications they can get a visual or audial walkthrough. The machine also has the ability for the user to call either their doctor, an assigned nurse or someone close if they require any assistance. Another issue with older style pill dispensers is that the user has the manually refill them. With this system the medication comes prepackaged and just has to be slotted into the machine. The package would be ordered by a nurse og a doctor.</p>

        <p>M.A.D.S. will benefit both the user and Oslo kommune. With MADS people can live alone longer and this will help free up space in nursing homes. The elderly population is increasing fast but the nursing personnel is not keeping up, with MADS we need less nurses because MADS will do a lot of the job.</p>
